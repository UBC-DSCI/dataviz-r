# Effective Data Visualization With R

This is the code repository for the Effective Data Viz with R activity, which is currently available on UBC's [StatSpace](https://statspace.elearning.ubc.ca/handle/123456789/332). The goal of this activity is for the students to expand their data visualization knowledge and toolset to create visualizations that use data to answer specific questions.


### Note about answers

The code in this repo has been modified so that the answer to all multiple choice questions is marked as (a). This, however, is not (always) correct and has been done to prevent cheating. If you are an instructor, you can download the solutions by logging in to StatSpace with instructor access.
